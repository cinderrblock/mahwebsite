 <h1>here's why pdf files are easier to print than docx files</h1> <br>
 let's ignore the ctrl+p keybind (the p LITERALLY STANDS FOR PRINT) <br>
 <h2>there is literally a print button on the right side of the screen (image below)</h2> <br>
 <img src="/resources/g.png" alt="print button that is circled in red" /> <br>
 <h2>however, on microsoft docs you have to hit like 10 trevigintillion buttons</h2> <br>
 (file -> print, like who wants to hit that many buttons to access the print dialog) <br>
 <h2>also you have to wait an undertermined amount of time based on how good your internet is because everything is hosted server-side and not client-side so every action you do can potentially take 7 quattuortrigintillion eternities to go through</h2> <br>
 can you tell i don't like the microsoft suite <br>
 <h1>anyways that's really it. also this whole thing could've been avoided if everyone knew about ctrl+p but hey not everyone knows what letter the word "print" starts with i get it</h1>
